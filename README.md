  **##Analyzing DQ**
  
    As per client's request we have analyzed performance of DQ over 2017 and 2018 to consider whether it is good security to invest.
    DQ was performimg well in 2017 but investing in DQ can be risky if we consider the analysis of 2018.
  
  **##Analzing the stocks of 2017**
  
    2017 has been a good year for investers where DQ provided about 200% rate of return to their investors. 
    However, reduced daily volume indicates that this share is not widely traded and held closely by a few investors.

  **##Analyzing the Stocks of 2018**
     
    Analysising market trends of 2018 shows that it has not been a good year for investors.  
    Rate of return has been generally negative for most of the investments including DQ, with ENPH and RUN being only exceptions.
    DQ's daily trading volume was again less than other competitors and had most decline in the rate of return when compared to others.

  **##conclusion**
    
    Stock markets are usually very unpredictable and historical results usually do not guarantee future performance. 
    Analyzing and compairing the data for both years shows best returns for the tickers "ENPH" and "RUN".
      
    **###Short term/Long term Investment**
      
    Investing in "ENPH" seems a better option for both short and long term investment. 
    It shows high daily volume and positive rate of return in both periods.
